          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>This case study details the successful Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy implemented for a growing e-commerce business specializing in health and wellness essentials. Operating on the Shopify platform, the client aimed to significantly increase organic visibility, attract qualified traffic, and boost online sales against established competitors. Despite offering high-quality products, their online presence was underdeveloped, resulting in missed opportunities for organic growth.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge: Low Organic Visibility &amp; Stagnant Sales</h2>
          <p>Prior to engaging our services, the client faced several key challenges:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Poor Search Engine Rankings:</strong> Key product and category pages ranked poorly for relevant, high-intent keywords, often appearing beyond the first few pages of search results.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Organic Traffic:</strong> The majority of website traffic came from paid advertising and direct sources, with organic search contributing a minimal percentage.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical SEO Issues:</strong> The Shopify store suffered from common technical SEO problems, including suboptimal site structure, duplicate content issues, slow page load speeds, and poor mobile usability scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Unoptimized Content:</strong> Product descriptions, category pages, and blog content lacked keyword optimization and failed to effectively address user search intent.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Authority:</strong> The website had a low domain authority and lacked high-quality backlinks, hindering its ability to compete in search rankings.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>The Strategy: A Holistic SEO Approach</h2>
          <p>We developed a multi-faceted SEO strategy tailored to the client's Shopify store and target audience, focusing on three core pillars: Technical SEO, On-Page Optimization, and Off-Page Authority Building.</p>

            <li>Optimization of site structure and internal linking for better crawlability and user navigation.</li>
            <li>Resolution of duplicate content issues using canonical tags and content refinement.</li>

            <li>Rewriting and expanding product descriptions to be unique, informative, and keyword-rich.</li>
            <li>Development of a content marketing strategy, including blog posts targeting informational keywords and addressing customer pain points.</li>
            <li>Optimization of Shopify collection pages for targeted category keywords.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Off-Page Authority Building:</h3>
